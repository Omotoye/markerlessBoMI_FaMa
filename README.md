3. It works exactly as the previous one the main changes are in the `select device` part. 3 other devices can now be controlled in a really similar way. 
For example in the case of "planar manipulator":

- By selecting it two successive windows will appear and Coppeliasim will open on your computer as follow:

- Execute the calibration and then the practice as in the previous cases (this last step may take some times).
- Now by moving the head the robot should move accordigly.
